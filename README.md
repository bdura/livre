# Livre

Livre, pronounced [[liv Å]](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/file:fr-un_livre-fr-ouest.ogg) (the french word for book)
aims to be a type-safe utility for parsing PDF documents.

Please note that this is a **very** early release, primarily meant as a motivational tool
for me to work towards an actually working release in the near future.

This first version already provides a sufficient set of low-level utilities to extract
all PDF primitive types in a type-safe manner.

## Obtaining the PDF specification

Thankfully, the ISO standards defining the PDF specification can be downloaded free of charge.
Visit the [PDF Association's website](https://pdfa.org/resource/iso-32000-pdf/) to get your version.

## Tentative roadmap

- [x] (`v0.1.0`) Low-level extraction utilities for primitive PDF types
- [x] (`v0.2.0`) Parser for cross-reference dictionary
- [x] (`v0.3.0`) Eager, owned instance of the `Builder` trait
- [x] (`v0.4.0`) Parser for the general PDF structure, allowing to iterate over pages and their content
- [x] (`v0.5.0`) Parser for pages' content operators & text content
- [ ] (`v0.6.0`) Parser for fonts definition - starting with "simple fonts".
      This step will allow iterating over characters and their actual position.
