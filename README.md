## About the name

Livre, pronounced [[liv Å]](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/File:Fr-un_livre-fr-ouest.ogg),
is the French word for book.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this is a **very** early release, primarily meant as a motivational tool
for me to work towards an actually working release in the near future.

At this time nothing is actually working, hence the `0.0.0` version tag.
