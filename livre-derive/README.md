# Derive macro for `livre` crate

See the [`livre` crate](https://crates.io/crates/livre) for more information on the project.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this is a **very** early release, primarily meant as a motivational tool
for me to work towards an actually working release in the near future.

At this time nothing is actually working, hence the `0.0.0` version tag.
